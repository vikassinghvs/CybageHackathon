 This app is very basic version of the planned application. Today about 27% of people in India die due to helath-related issues.
  The very basic problem is finding the best option out of all options in the case of emergency with all the constraints applied.
  The idea to root out the same with the help of application.
  The app would have features like (1) Real time tracking of doctors.
                                   (2) Finding best suitable option with applied constraints like private/public and need.
                                   (3) Single click emergency button.
                                   (4) Booking bed and ambulance by app in public and private hospitals during emergency.
